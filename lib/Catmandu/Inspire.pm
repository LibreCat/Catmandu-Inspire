LibreCat is an open collaboration. Currently the three Universites of Lund, Gent and Bielefeld provide freely available tools for library and research services. We believe that LibreCat is a valuable set of applications and we would like to ensure its continued development for future innovations in the field of digital libraries and research services.

The applications should be perceived as supplementary tools to serve your unique local need without loosing interoperability and standardisation already achieved.

LibreCat invites academic institutions with own development expertise to reuse and contribute. If you want to take an active part in LibreCat, please feel free to contact LibreCat Management.
